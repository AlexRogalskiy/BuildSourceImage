# BuildSourceImage
Tool to build a source image based on an existing OCI image


This script uses BUILDAH to build source code container images based on
existing OCI images.

The goal is to make retrieving the source code used to make a container image
easier for users to obtain, using the standard OCI protocols and image formats.
